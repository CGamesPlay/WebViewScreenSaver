# WebViewScreenSaver

This project is designed to enable web developers to easily create web pages
that can be used as native screensavers on Mac OS X. The prebuilt binary should
be sufficient in most cases, and can be modified without even requiring Xcode.

# What needs to be done

* The embedded WebView doesn't seem to be able to keep any state around:
  neither cookies nor localStorage are working.

# Thanks

I borrowed some code from [liquidx's
webviewscreensaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver/), so mad
propz.
